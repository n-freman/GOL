# Game Of Life (GOL)


**_Not Conway game of life & not a cellular automaton_**  
**P. S: but the title was inspired by the Conway's game**

This app helps track progress in different aspects of life.
You can:
- add actions with scores
- add actions with negative score (something you should not have done)
- get actions for the current week
